## üîß Integration Tips

### 1. Error Handling
All advanced AI endpoints return structured error responses:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Detailed error message",
  "code": "SPECIFIC_ERROR_CODE"
}
```

### 2. Validation
- Required fields are validated before processing
- Invalid data formats return 400 status codes
- Missing authentication returns 401 status codes

### 3. Performance
- Use appropriate parameters to control processing time
- Seasonal forecasting with shorter time horizons processes faster
- Cache results when possible for repeated queries

### 4. Mock Data
- The current implementation uses realistic mock data
- Integrations with real weather APIs, economic data sources, and ML models can be added
- All interfaces are designed for production-ready implementations

## üéØ Use Cases

### Construction Season Planning
```bash

```

### Competitive Pricing Strategy
```bash
# Analyze current market conditions for steel products
POST /api/ai/advanced/dynamic-pricing  
# Implement recommended pricing strategy
# Monitor competitor responses and adjust
```

### Supply Chain Risk Management
```bash
# Assess key supplier risks quarterly
POST /api/ai/advanced/supplier-risk
# Evaluate alternative suppliers
# Implement recommended risk mitigation strategies
```

## üìà Monitoring & Health
