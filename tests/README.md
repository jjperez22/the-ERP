- Performance measurement helpers
- Validation helpers

### ✅ Controller Tests
- Basic controller structure verification
- Import/export testing

### ✅ API Tests  
- Response structure validation
- Error handling patterns
- Mock API response testing

## Running Tests

Since Node.js is not available in the current environment, tests can be run in a proper development environment using:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test files
npm test -- --testPathPattern=AdvancedAI

# Run specific test suites
npm test -- --testNamePattern="Seasonal Demand"
```

## Test Configuration

- **Framework**: Jest 29.6+
- **Language**: TypeScript with ts-jest
- **Matchers**: jest-extended for additional matchers
- **Setup**: Global test utilities and environment configuration
- **Coverage**: Configured to generate coverage reports

## Key Features Tested

### Advanced AI Service
1. **Initialization & Health**
   - Service startup and configuration
   - Health status monitoring
   - Error handling

2. **Seasonal Demand Forecasting**
   - Weather data integration
   - Economic indicators processing
   - Time horizon flexibility (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Confidence scoring
   - Seasonal pattern recognition

3. **Dynamic Pricing Analysis**
   - Market condition assessment
   - Price elasticity calculation
   - Competitive pressure analysis
   - Pricing strategy recommendations
   - Scenario generation

4. **Supplier Risk Assessment**
   - Risk factor analysis (financial, operational, geographical)
   - Risk score calculation (0-100 scale)
   - Alternative supplier identification
   - Actionable recommendations

### Basic AI Service
- SKU generation with intelligent formatting
- Price suggestions with markup calculation
- Demand forecasting with seasonal adjustments
- Inventory recommendations
- Customer churn prediction
- Supply chain optimization

## Mock Data Generators

The test suite includes comprehensive mock data generators for:
- Weather data (current conditions and forecasts)
- Economic indicators (construction index, interest rates, etc.)
- Market conditions (competitive analysis, supply chain status)
- Forecasting parameters
- AI model configuration
- Seasonal scenarios (winter, competitive markets, premium markets)

## Test Utilities

Additional utilities provide:
- Performance measurement
- Data validation helpers
- Mock API response generators
- Test cleanup functions
- Random data generation

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Isolation**: Each test is independent with proper setup/teardown
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
3. **Realistic Data**: Mock data mimics real-world scenarios
4. **Performance Testing**: Execution time verification for critical operations
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper typing
6. **Maintainability**: Clear test organization and naming conventions

## Environment Requirements

- Node.js 18.0.0+
- npm 9.0.0+
- TypeScript 5.1+
- Jest 29.6+

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "ts-jest": "^29.1.0",
  "jest-extended": "^4.0.0"
}
```

## Future Enhancements

When full environment is available, tests can be extended to include:

### Integration Tests
- Database integration testing
- External API testing  
- End-to-end workflow testing

### Controller Tests
- Express request/response mocking
- Authentication middleware testing
- Database operation testing

### API Tests
- Supertest integration for HTTP testing
- Authentication flow testing
- Rate limiting testing
- Database seeding for integration tests

## Notes

This test suite was built incrementally in small, manageable steps:
1. Jest configuration and setup
2. Mock data generators
3. Basic service initialization tests
4. Seasonal forecasting tests
5. Dynamic pricing tests
6. Supplier risk assessment tests
7. Additional utilities and helpers
8. Controller and API structure tests

Each step was focused and achievable, making the development process manageable and the codebase maintainable.
